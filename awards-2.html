To win this award teams must be able to balance functionality and aesthetics to make their robot look impressive on and off the field. </p><p><strong><u>How this team won the Design Award:</u></strong> The Hyperdroid signature color is pink, and they made sure to incorporate this into their robot’s design during the 24/25 season. To enhance both functionality and aesthetics, they 3D printed many of their robots’ parts, allowing them to create an eye-catching sleek look for their robot while still maintaining efficiency.</p><p><span style="font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"><strong><u>Innovate award 2nd place</u></strong>: The innovation award is given to the team that can find split second solutions for their robot. To win this award means you have to be able to fix the robot even in high pressure situations like competitions. This, "[a]ward celebrates a team that thinks imaginatively and has the ingenuity, creativity, and inventiveness."</span></p><p><strong><u>How this team became Innovate Award Finalists: </u></strong>To get 2nd place for this award Hyperdroid had demonstrate quick thinking and problem-solving under immense pressure. We can see this during one of their competitions when a piece of their robot broke off and the team had to make a split-second decision on how to fix it in the middle of the event. As a result of this incident, they began keeping extra parts for all the 3D-printed components on their robot, ensuring they could quickly repair or replace broken pieces during future competitions. </p><p><strong><u>Inspire award 3rd place</u></strong>: The inspire award is given to the team who positively impacts their community by demonstrating Gracious Professionalism both on and off the field. This includes helping others by using information they have obtained during the season to ensure everyone else has the same chances they had. </p><p><strong><u>How this team got 3rd place for the Inspire </u></strong><strong><u>Award:</u></strong> The Hyperdroids along with the association they are a part of are helping a school called Renfrew Educational Services—a school dedicated to children with learning disabilities. The children that go to this school interact with toys differently, which often leads to expensive adaptions so all kids can play with the toys. To help out the school the association has been helping fix the already broken toys for free to ensure each child gets the same opportunities.  Hyperdroids demonstrated <em data-start="698" data-end="724">Gracious Professionalism</em> and a commitment to making a meaningful impact.</p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul><li><a href="https://10015.ca/meet-the-team.html" class="al" title="Team" target="_self">Team</a></li><li><a href="https://10015.ca/mentors.html" class="al" target="_self">Mentors</a></li><li><a href="https://10015.ca/outreach.html" class="al" target="_self">Outreach</a></li><li><a href="https://10015.ca/sponsers.html" class="al" target="_self">Sponsers</a></li><li class="active"><a href="https://10015.ca/awards-2.html" class="al" target="_self">Awards</a></li></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://10015.ca/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://10015.ca/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
