This can be proven by looking at previous years of success where they have gone to the Alberta Championships twice and have gone to the World Championships once.</p><p>Over the past season this team has won many awards such as:</p><p>Design award: This award is given to the team who has the most efficent and eye catching design. The team has to keep in mind aesthetics and function while making the design.</p><p>Innovate award Finalists: The innovate award is given to the team that has solutions for their robot on the spotthis would also include high pressure situations such as competitions. This, "[a]ward celebrates a team that thinks imaginatively and has the ingenuity, creativity, and inventiveness".</p><p>Inspire award 3rd place: The inspire award is given to the team who helps out their community for the better in any way possible by using Gracious Professionalism on and off the field. The team would share the knowlege the obtained during the season to help other so that they can have the same chances.</p><p><strong>Outreach:</strong>This term is used to define someone promoting STEM and FIRST through community events and mentoring. Outreach is a key item in robotics because you can help other teams succeed so they have a fun season. Some outreach our team has done during the 2025 season is:</p><p>Working closely and providing advice to: 4 Aberhart High School robotics teams (22212, 13898, 11712, 20176) and STEM Inovation Academy teams (27272, 27953, 27273).</p><p>One item out team has accomplished and helped the community is by fixing toys for the Renfrew Educational School. This school is for special needs children which means the toys that have need to be adapted so every kid can use them. This process is very expenisive so our organization (including our team) has helped in fixing these toys for free.  The toys we fixed were toys that were already owned by the school.</p><p><span style="color: #000000;">Meet the team (previous expirence and team role) </span></p><p><strong>Driver</strong>: Anjalika </p><p><strong>Pit crew</strong>: Mrigaj- Before Mrigaj started FTC he did FLL (Lego League). His job on the team is to handle nearly all the hardware related items and to ensure the robot is working up to the high expectations before any match including practice ones. Mrigaj is on pit crew this means that after a match there could be a hidden issue in the robot that could be crucial if not fixed or discovered by the pit crew. Mrigaj's rookie year was 2024 were he started to learn CAD and the pit crew. Mirgaj has learned many items that help him do his role on the team more efficiently. </p><p><strong>Drive coach, programmer:</strong> Tirth- Tirth is the drive coach for out team! He helps the drivers on the feild and gives them advice on how to improve in future matches. The 2024 season was Tirths rookie year in FTC robotics, his job on the team then was pit crew. Since it was his first year he knew very little about robotics but drastically improving over the year has helped him use his knowlege to be a drive coach now. </p><p><strong>Human Player, PR:</strong> Anna- Annas main job on the team is to design all the graphics for the team's PR and function of as the Human Player at competions. She is the PR lead which means she controls our main social media platforms and bring encourageing STEM messages to the community. Annas rookie year was 2024 were she was also PR lead.</p><p><strong>Team Lead, Designer, Programmer: </strong>Adrian - Adrian is the team captin, this means he ensures everyone on the team has somethign to do that they enjoy and see the benifits of each decision the team makes. He also over sees our CAD and design process to make sure that everything will run smoothly or efficiently both at competions and at the buildspace. </p><p><strong>Pit Crew:</strong>Carter- Carter is the lead for the pit crew this means his role on the team is to make sure robot leaves the robot in perfect condition for every match </p><p><strong>Programmer</strong>: Ilyas- Ilyas's job on the team is to write, test, and improve the code that controls the robots actions and movements. His job also requires him to check with the rest of the team on how smooth the code is running. The 2025 season is Ilyas's rookie year, even though this is his first year he has obtained lots of knowlege about coding. </p><p><strong>Operator, Programmer</strong>: Mahie- Mahies job on our team is to be the operator this means she controls the robot's arm and claw mechanisms. During competions she has to carefully collaborate with the driver so they can efficiently work. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div></header><figure class="hero__image"><div class="hero__image-wrapper"><img src="https://10015.ca/media/website/IMG_3598.jpeg" srcset="https://10015.ca/media/website/responsive/IMG_3598-xs.jpeg 640w, https://10015.ca/media/website/responsive/IMG_3598-sm.jpeg 768w, https://10015.ca/media/website/responsive/IMG_3598-md.jpeg 1024w, https://10015.ca/media/website/responsive/IMG_3598-lg.jpeg 1366w, https://10015.ca/media/website/responsive/IMG_3598-xl.jpeg 1600w, https://10015.ca/media/website/responsive/IMG_3598-2xl.jpeg 1920w" sizes="88vw" loading="eager" width="1242" height="2208" alt=""></div><figcaption>A team picture from 2025 Alberta Championships</figcaption></figure></div><div class="wrapper feed"></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul><li><a href="https://10015.ca/meet-the-team.html" class="al" title="Team" target="_self">Team</a></li></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://10015.ca/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://10015.ca/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
