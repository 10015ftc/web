It plays a big role in robotics as this helps make sure other teams get the same opportunities that they may not have received without help. Some of the outreach our team has done during the 24/25 season includes: </p><p><strong>Helping teams:</strong></p><p>Our team has provided a large amount of support and guidance to several robotics’ teams over the season. Members of the team worked closely and gave advice to:</p><ul><li>4 teams from Aberhart High School (22212, 13898, 11712, 20176)</li><li>3 teams from STEM Innovation Academy (27272, 27953, 27273)</li></ul><p><strong>Renfrew toy Adaptation:</strong></p><p>One of the many impactful ways our team has been helping out the community is by repairing toys for Renfrew Educational Services, a school that supports children with learning disabilities. Many of the toys at this school have to be adapted so that each kid can play with them. For example, most of the adaptations these toys require are buttons, these are added to toys so that kids can lightly press them and still play with the toys other kids use. However, this adaptation process is expensive, as it involves purchasing the toys and then sending them to specialists for modification. To help this school our team, along with the association we're part of, has been repairing these toys for free. The toys that were being fixed were already owned by the school but had been broken due to wear and tear. By fixing these toys this made sure that kids wouldn’t feel left out because they couldn’t use the toys other kids could.</p><p> </p><p> </p></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><nav class="footer__nav"><ul><li><a href="https://10015.ca/home.html" class="al" target="_self">Home</a></li><li><a href="https://10015.ca/meet-the-team.html" class="al" title="Team" target="_self">Team</a></li><li><a href="https://10015.ca/mentors.html" class="al" target="_self">Mentors</a></li><li class="active"><a href="https://10015.ca/outreach.html" class="al" target="_self">Outreach</a></li><li><a href="https://10015.ca/sponsers.html" class="al" target="_self">Sponsers</a></li><li><a href="https://10015.ca/awards-2.html" class="al" target="_self">Awards</a></li></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://10015.ca/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://10015.ca/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
